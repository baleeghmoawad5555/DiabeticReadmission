# Diabetic Readmission

### Abstract
The increasing prevalence of diabetes and its associated hospital readmissions pose a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Readmissions are costly, disruptive to patients’ health, and represents a burden on healthcare providers. This study aims to tackle the rising burden of hospital readmissions among diabetic patients by developing and evaluating different advanced machine learning models.

Aiming to predict readmission risk with highest accuracy, this research seeks to empower healthcare providers with valuable insights and contribute to the efficient allocation of resources to improve the quality of healthcare. In addition, the analysis of patient demographics offers valuable insights into factors influencing readmission risk, enabling healthcare providers to develop personalized prevention strategies, lowering healthcare costs, and potentially reducing hospital readmission rates, thus making a significant contribution to the field of diabetic patient care.

We analyze the exploration of the data and we extracted the insights from our data and we make the relationship between the most important features by using python and power bi. We decided to train nine classification machine learning models which is (Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearst Neighbor, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Catboost. we tried hyperparameter tuning and cross validation and feature selection. We achieved high accuracy with Catboost model which is 95%.
